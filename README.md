**Important Information**

I would like to note that I'm not the original creator of this mod. This was a mod I was fascinated over when I was a kid and I never was able to play it. The original mod is called Pre-Historic Mod it was for Minecraft 1.4.2. I have simply updated the mod for the newer versions of Minecraft and I am open to any suggestions and recommendations of what should become of this mod in the future. I have added features that were not contained in the original mod and modified others. This mod is still in work in progress and I hope to continue this project well into the future. The video [Minecraft PRE-HISTORIC MOD Spotlight - Jurassic Park! (Minecraft Dinosaur Mod Showcase)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj2WKT4iYzQ) was what I saw when I first witnessed this mod all those years ago and I still love it to this day. Although the video is old, it still is practically accurate for this mod I have resurrected.

## Credits

Although I am not the original author of this mod I have put extreme amounts of effort into this porject I will continue to do so. I'm not entirely sure of the original creators name because the original files of this mod are practically impossible to find, but I believe he goes by the username of ProPercivalalb.

Sound Effects used in this mod were from youtube audio clips, the prehistoric ambience used are from the Youtube channel name, [Uzbazur Second Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5-RFgy-udH0umXzXxVETwg), and it was his Prehistoric Relaxing Soundscape (1Hour Special) video.
